<h1>Password strength checker</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I created a password strenth checker, which is a tool designed to assess the strenth of a password based on several criteria. By checking length and ensuring the password contains a single number, special character, uppercase, and lowercase letters, the program provides suggestions to help users create stronger passwords, and it also ensures that a password contains at least 12 characters.
