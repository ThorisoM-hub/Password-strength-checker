<h1>Password strength checker</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I created a password strength checker, which is a tool designed to assess the strenth of a password based on several criteria. By checking length and ensuring the password contains a single number, special character, uppercase, and lowercase letters, the program provides suggestions to help users create stronger passwords, and it also ensures that a password contains at least 12 characters. 

<h2>Why is password security important?<h1></h2>
•
Protection against cyber threats:strong passwords help to protect personal(PII) and sensitive information from unauthorized access.
  
•
Prevention of data breaches: passwords are first line of defense against cybercriminals therefore having strict policies for passwords security is important to prevent data breaches which could result in financial losses for both businesses and customers.

<h1>Guidelines for creating secure passwords according to NIST<h1>

     •Use passwords that are 8 to 15 characters long.
     •Use password managers
     •Regularly update passwords.
     •Implement multi-factor authentication.
